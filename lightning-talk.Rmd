# Code for Preliminary Data

```{r}
tube_growth = read_csv(here("./data/tube-growth.csv"))
knitr::kable(tube_growth, caption = "Tube growth rates of all marked worms in various treatments.")

tank_conditions = read_csv(here("./data/tank-conditions.csv"))
knitr::kable(tank_conditions, caption = "Tank conditions of all treatment tanks over course of experiment.")

mortality = read_csv(here("./data/mortality.csv"))
knitr::kable(mortality, caption = "Mortality of worms in all treatments.")
```

## Make scatterplot for growth of each worm
```{r}
clean_tube_growth <- tube_growth %>%
  select(worm_id, treatment, growth_1, growth_2) %>%
  pivot_longer(!c(worm_id, treatment),
               names_to = "timestep",

ggplot(data = clean_tube_growth, aes(x = timestep, y = growth, colour = worm_id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

## Make a boxplot for final growth
```{r}
ggplot(tube_growth, aes(x = treatment, y = total_growth)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8)

ggplot(snailed_it, aes(x = Exposure, y = Percent_survival, fill = Species)) +

# Stats

## Total growth

### Check for normality
```{r}
growth_total <- tube_growth %>%
  select(total_growth)

shapiro.test(growth_total)
```

### histogram and qqplot
```{r}
hist(growth_total)

qqnorm(growth_total)
qqline(growth_total)
```

### Finding distribution of data
```{r}
descdist(tube_growth$total_growth)
```



### Anova
```{r}
aov_total_growth <- aov(total_growth ~ treatment + (1|worm_id)+ (1|amt_cut_mm), data = tube-growth)
```


## Timestep growth

#### check for normality
```{r}
# first timestep
growth_ts_1 <- tube-growth %>%
  select(growth_1)

shapiro.test(growth_ts_1)

# second timestep
growth_ts_2 <- tube-growth %>%
  select(growth_2)

shapiro.test(growth_ts_2)

# third timestep
growth_ts_3 <- tube-growth %>%
  select(growth_3)

shapiro.test(growth_ts_3)

# fourth timestep
growth_ts_4 <- tube-growth %>%
  select(growth_4)

shapiro.test(growth_ts_4)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
