## Summary: 
Welcome! This repository was created for our Directed Studies and Applied Data Analysis courses at Bamfield Marine Science Centre in the Fall of 2021. For our research project we investigated how the tube growth of *Eudistylia vancouveri* is impacted by increases in temperature and decreases in salinity. This repository contains the data and code necessary to reproduce the results reported in our research project: Abiotic tolerances of the foundational species *Eudistylia vancouveri*.
